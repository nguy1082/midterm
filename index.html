    <p>The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation has announced the 2024 nominees for induction into the Rock Hall. Leading the class of 2024 nominees are first-timers Oasis, Sinéad O’Connor, Sade, Mariah Carey, and Ozzy Osbourne. Repeat nominees include A Tribe Called Quest, Eric B. & Rakim, and Mary J. Blige. See the full list of nominees below.</p>

    <p>Musicians become eligible for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame 25 years after the release of their first commercial recording. So, while there are 10 first-time nominees—Mariah Carey, Cher, Foreigner, Peter Frampton, Kool & the Gang, Lenny Kravitz, Oasis, Sinéad O’Connor, Ozzy Osbourne, and Sade—each act has been eligible for induction in past years.</p>

    <p>There are only five nominated acts who have been nominated in the past: A Tribe Called Quest (2022, 2023), Mary J. Blige (2021), Dave Matthews Band (2020), Jane’s Addiction (2017), and Eric B. & Rakim (2012). Ozzy Osbourne is also in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, but as a member of Black Sabbath—not as a solo act.</p>

    <p>Kate Bush, Missy Elliott, Sheryl Crow, Rage Against the Machine, Willie Nelson, George Michael, and the Spinners were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with the class of 2023.</p>

    <p>The nominees from last year’s ballot who are not repeating in 2023 are: Cyndi Lauper, Iron Maiden, Joy Division/New Order, Soundgarden, Warren Zevon, and the White Stripes.</p>
    
    <p>John Sykes, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation’s chairman, said in a press statement, “This remarkable list of nominees reflects the diverse artists and music that the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame honors and celebrates. Continuing in the true spirit of Rock & Roll, these artists have created their own sounds that have impacted generations and influenced countless others that have followed in their footsteps.”</p>
